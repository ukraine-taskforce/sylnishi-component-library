#### I get `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`?

This can occur if you use Node version > 16.
You either have to downgrade your Node version or run the following command beforehand:

UNIX:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

Windows:
```powershell
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```
### `npm test`

Run the tests

### `npm run rollup`

It correctly bundles the library in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
